# Operation Log

Append-only. A long gap here is an honest signal the wiki may be going stale — see
`PLAN-second-brain-integration.md`'s Trade-offs section.

## 2026-07-27 — First ingest pass (structure build + seed content)

Built the vault structure (`CLAUDE.md`, `Raw/`, `Inbox/`, `Wiki/Index.md`, `Wiki/Log.md`,
`Wiki/Entities/`, `Wiki/Concepts/`, `Wiki/Summaries/`) per
`PLAN-second-brain-integration.md` v1 and the accompanying build prompt.

Ingested 13 real sources into `Raw/` (memory files copied verbatim, plus verbatim git log
output, a `firestore.rules` excerpt, and a Ponytail rulebook excerpt) — no invented filler
content.

Produced:
- 6 Entity pages: Multi-Tenant Architecture, Tier System, Firestore Rules, Fleet Captain
  Permission Gap, Rank Config and Achievement Badges, Git Worktrees
- 4 Concept pages: UI-Says-Yes-Server-Says-No Pattern, Anti-Recurrence Check,
  Draft-Then-Deploy Discipline, Ponytail Philosophy
- 9 Summary pages, one per ingested source group (see Wiki/Index.md for the full list)

Every summary ripples to at least one Entity/Concept page; every Entity/Concept page cites
at least one summary. Cross-links verified by hand during writing — no orphan pages.

One honest gap flagged in Wiki/Index.md rather than papered over: offline/PWA-specific
material doesn't have a clean Entity home yet, and feature-level "how it actually works"
knowledge (Fleet & Canvas, Stock Opname, etc.) isn't covered in this first pass.

Next ingest candidates: the recovered NOO/`handlePhotoCapture` incident in more depth (right
now it's only touched via the worktree-incident summary), the Customer/Notification scoping
investigation (`project_kpm_customer_notification_scoping` memory, not yet ingested), and
whatever real material accumulates from future sessions.

## 2026-07-27 — Tidy pass (frontmatter, titles, MOC)

No new content ingested — this pass made the existing vault easier for a human to actually
browse:

- Added `title`/`description` frontmatter to all 19 Wiki pages (Entities/Concepts/Summaries),
  all 12 `Raw/` sources (display fields only — no source text touched), all 9 `Backlog/`
  cards, and both `Brainstorm/` pages. `Raw/` filenames were deliberately left as-is (their
  `date_source_slug` naming is the documented convention for immutable sources, not a
  mistake) — they now carry a readable `title:` for display instead.
- Built `Wiki/MOC.md` — a Map of Content organized by topic (Security & Permissions,
  Process & Discipline, Architecture, Incidents), meant as the actual human starting point.
  `Wiki/Index.md` stays as the flat A-Z catalog for AI queries; both now point at each other.
- Removed `Welcome.md` and `create a link.md` — Obsidian's stock onboarding notes, empty of
  real content and not linked from anything real. Recoverable via git if that was wrong.
- Verified every `[[wikilink]]` in `Wiki/`, `Backlog/`, `Brainstorm/`, and the new MOC
  resolves to a real file — zero dangling links introduced. The only unresolved `[[...]]`
  references left in the vault are pre-existing ones inside `Raw/` files, pointing at the
  original Claude memory system's slugs (e.g. `project_kpm_rules_draft_process`) rather than
  vault pages — these predate this pass and are out of scope to fix since `Raw/` content
  can't be edited.
- `CLAUDE.md` updated: documents `Wiki/MOC.md` in the vault map, and adds a step to the
  Ingest operation so future passes keep the MOC and frontmatter current, not just the Index.
