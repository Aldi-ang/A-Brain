# Operation Log

Append-only. A long gap here is an honest signal the wiki may be going stale — see
`PLAN-second-brain-integration.md`'s Trade-offs section.

## 2026-07-27 — First ingest pass (structure build + seed content)

Built the vault structure (`CLAUDE.md`, `Raw/`, `Inbox/`, `Wiki/Index.md`, `Wiki/Log.md`,
`Wiki/Entities/`, `Wiki/Concepts/`, `Wiki/Summaries/`) per
`PLAN-second-brain-integration.md` v1 and the accompanying build prompt.

Ingested 13 real sources into `Raw/` (memory files copied verbatim, plus verbatim git log
output, a `firestore.rules` excerpt, and a Ponytail rulebook excerpt) — no invented filler
content.

Produced:
- 6 Entity pages: Multi-Tenant Architecture, Tier System, Firestore Rules, Fleet Captain
  Permission Gap, Rank Config and Achievement Badges, Git Worktrees
- 4 Concept pages: UI-Says-Yes-Server-Says-No Pattern, Anti-Recurrence Check,
  Draft-Then-Deploy Discipline, Ponytail Philosophy
- 9 Summary pages, one per ingested source group (see Wiki/Index.md for the full list)

Every summary ripples to at least one Entity/Concept page; every Entity/Concept page cites
at least one summary. Cross-links verified by hand during writing — no orphan pages.

One honest gap flagged in Wiki/Index.md rather than papered over: offline/PWA-specific
material doesn't have a clean Entity home yet, and feature-level "how it actually works"
knowledge (Fleet & Canvas, Stock Opname, etc.) isn't covered in this first pass.

Next ingest candidates: the recovered NOO/`handlePhotoCapture` incident in more depth (right
now it's only touched via the worktree-incident summary), the Customer/Notification scoping
investigation (`project_kpm_customer_notification_scoping` memory, not yet ingested), and
whatever real material accumulates from future sessions.
