2026-07-26: pushed `claude/critical-bugs-permissions-batch-c3371f` to GitHub and opened **PR #3**: https://github.com/Aldi-ang/kpm-inventory/pull/3 — see [[project_kpm_batch2_unmerged_discovery]] for what the branch contains. **NOT merged yet** — waiting on the project owner to say whether they want to review the diff themselves or have it merged directly for them.

**Re-verification done before pushing (don't trust old claims, re-check):**
- Diffed branch vs `main`: `main` is still a strict ancestor (hadn't moved since branch creation) — clean fast-forward, zero conflicts.
- Re-ran `rules-test/test-batch1.mjs` and `rules-test/test-batch2.mjs` live against a fresh Firestore emulator (JDK 21, in the existing `critical-bugs-permissions-batch-c3371f` worktree, deps installed with `npm install --no-save` to avoid dirtying the worktree's tracked files): **26/26 and 8/8 passing**, matching the original commit message claims exactly.
- Ran `npm run build` on the branch tip: succeeds cleanly (only the pre-existing >500kB chunk-size warning, nothing new).

**CI confirmed working on this exact PR**: the `build-check.yml` GitHub Action (added in `fcb255b`, this is its first real workout) triggered automatically on PR #3 and passed — job "build", 43s, Status: Success. Checked live via the Actions run page, not assumed from a prior local build.

**How this PR was created**: no `gh` CLI or GitHub API token available in the sandboxed environment. Pushed via plain `git push` (existing credential manager handled auth, same as the `kpm-notes` push). PR itself was created via the `mcp__claude-in-chrome` browser tools — the user's real Chrome had an existing authenticated GitHub session, so no credentials were entered by Claude. The sandboxed in-app browser tool tried first and was NOT logged in — don't use it for authenticated GitHub actions in this project, use claude-in-chrome instead.

**UPDATE 2026-07-26 — MERGED.** Owner chose "merge it for me now" when asked. Merged via the PR's own Merge button (not a raw command-line merge) — merge commit `a8fc57c` on `main`. Local `kpm-inventory-main` fast-forwarded to match and spot-checked (firestore.rules has the rank-config rule, useDatabaseSync.js has all 13 error-handler sites). Build Check ran TWICE for real and passed both times: run #2 (triggered by the PR itself) and run #3 (triggered by the push of the merge commit to `main`) — both green, ~38-43s. Branch `claude/critical-bugs-permissions-batch-c3371f` NOT deleted (left as-is, wasn't asked to clean it up).

**Still true and unchanged by this merge:** the firestore.rules changes that came in are still NOT deployed to Firebase — that's a separate manual `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` step per [[project_kpm_rules_draft_process]]. The "Merge Batch 1+2" backlog card in the kpm-notes vault ([[project_kpm_notes_vault_relocated]]) should be flipped to Done and "Deploy firestore.rules to production" is now the single next real action.

**How to apply:** if a future session revisits this, the merge is done — don't re-verify or re-propose it. Next relevant action for this project is the rules deploy, which needs the owner physically present per the deploy checklist.
